# Karinna Lopez

## Hello!  
I am Karinna Lopez.  
### Get to Know Me
I am a designer for functional, captivating online experiences.
As a recent graduate from Eastern Washington University, I have a Bachelor of Design (BDes) along with a User Experience (UX) Certificate and Spanish minor. I am bilingual in both English and Spanish; proficiencies include understanding, reading, writing, and speaking.
My process incorporates user research, content modeling, prototyping, usability testing along with identifying the needs and behaviors of users to satisfy their goals as well as client and development goals. Skill proficiency can be demonstrated in graphic design, user interface, and prototyping tools.
I thrive on challenges. I am a question-asker, an answer-seeker. I innovatively strategize and demonstrate a level of attention to detail that is unparalleled. I accept personal accountability and am deeply committed to the highest standard of positive work ethic and humility to ensure quality.
I am deeply interested in making connections between us and the present digital domain, along with having a focus on the future we are continually building for ourselves. This is a path of life-long learning, which I am consistently taking the initiative to learn and passing it along for the benefit of others.

## Pet Fetch  
*Information Architecture, Prototyping*
### The Service
Pet Fetch is a pet-to-owner matchmaking adoption service designed to achieve a simpler, more streamlined process in finding you a lasting pet companion. We have observed that current services are causing more pets to be returned to shelters and foster homes. By automating the research and matching pets to your preferred preferences, we make pet adoptions last.

### Refinement
I would reassess screen transitions.
### Design Charrettes
Design charrettes inspires ideas, provides an opportunity for collaboration, explores and exposes the objectives of colleagues in multiple functional roles, and drive off designer’s block.
### Wireframes
Using the shared solution derived from the design charrettes, each member of the group was expected to create their own wireframes and perform their own tests. It was my individual effort for the following wireframes and two recorded, qualitative usability tests.
### High-Fidelity Prototypes
I prototyped Pet Fetch for both iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 4.
Building my prototypes was a challenge in itself — I took up learning the basics of InVision Studio in a matter of days to have more expansive animating options.

## Alexa...  
*User Experience Research, Voice-User Interface*
### 100 Years of Bauhaus Exhibition
The Staatliches Bauhaus, a German art school that was operational from 1919 to 1933, had a radical concept of reimagining the material world into one that united art and design. With a modern reimagination of how users interact with technology, “Alexa…” is designed through a voice-user interface: Amazon Alexa. Voice-user interfaces allow users to interact with a system through voice commands.  
There are no visual indications are to what the Amazon Alexa can do or what options are available, but nine card prompts have been provided to aid users in their experience. They follow as such:  
“Alexa, shuffle Bauhaus playlist.”  
“Alexa, skip.”  
Music is an unexpected, yet effective, form of art—it is the inspirational foundation of this project. The Bauhaus playlist has select, upbeat music that was brought to life in the era of operation for the German art school. “Alexa…” aspires to form an environment in which users feel comfortable using voice-user interfaces in public settings.

### Refinement
I would reassess the exhibition display.
### Design Charrettes
The outward-facing sides of the cards form the classic Bauhaus signet, which reflects various of the movement’s principles such as a minimalistic approach and pleasing aesthetic.
